  <p>These are the features in the JAVA Programming Language. <br />For more explanation, please continue reading.</p>
  <h2>Explination of Features in JAVA Programming Language</h2>
  <h3>Simple</h3>
  <p>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun, Java
    language is a simple programming language because:
  <ul>
    <li>Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).</li>
    <li>Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator
      overloading, etc.</li>
    <li>There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Object-oriented</h3>
  <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we
    organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.
    Basic concepts of OOPs are:
  <ul class="numbered-list">
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Class</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Abstraction</li>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Platform Independent</h3>
  <p>Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C,C++, etc. which are compiled
    into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or
    software environment in which a program runs.<br>
    <br>Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java
    code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code
    because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
  </p>
  <h3>Secured</h3>
  <p>
    Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
  <ul>
    <li>No explicit pointer</li>
    <li>Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox</li>
    <li>Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE) which is used to load Java
      classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the
      classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.</li>
    <li>Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access right to objects.
    </li>
    <li>Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local
      disk.</li>
  </ul>
  Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application developer
  explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc.
  </p>
  <h3>Robust</h3>
  <p>
    Robust simply means strong. Java is robust because:
  <ul>
    <li>It uses strong memory management.</li>
    <li>There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.</li>
    <li>There is automatic garbage collection in java which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects
      which are not being used by a Java application anymore.</li>
    <li>There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Architecture neutral</h3>
  <p>
    Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of
    primitive types is fixed.<br>
    In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for
    64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.<br>

  </p>
  <h3>Interpreted</h3>
  <p>JAVA code is compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the JVM at runtime, providing flexibility and
    enabling dynamic execution.
  </p>
  <h3>Portable</h3>
  <p>
    Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any
    implementation.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>High performance</h3>
  <p>Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to
    native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted
    language that is why it is slower than compiled languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.</p>
  <h3>Distributed</h3>
  <p>Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used
    for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods
    from any machine on the internet.</p>
  <h3>Multi-threaded</h3>
  <p>A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks
    at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for
    each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.</p>
  <h3>Dynamic</h3>
  <p>Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It
    also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.
    Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).
